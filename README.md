# Repl.it Programming Languages Jam

[This Jam](https://blog.repl.it/langjam) is a great excuse for me to work on Extol again. I've created a team [here](https://repl.it/@Extollers). I plan to add:

- [x] repl
- [x] syntax improvements
- [x] Emacs mode
- [x] include statement
- [x] functions and expressions
- [x] stack traces
- [ ] clause transformation by annotation
- [ ] proper AST instead of raw Prolog terms
- [ ] compile-time type checking
- [ ] custom prelude to wrap Prolog predicates
- [ ] anonymous predicates and lambdas
- [ ] first-class predicates and functions
- [ ] modules and namespaces
- [ ] open sets and maps

# Existing Features

- [x] a Prolog parser in Prolog that can parse itself
- [x] a Prolog generator for the parsed declarations
- [x] runtime type checking

# Further ideas

- explicit lexical elements
- extensible lexical elements
- middle-out parsing
- â†’ parser for C
- types and constraints
- Unicode
- rich library of data types
- non-binary const, open sets and maps
- parser for Python
- parser for JavaScript
- parser for Bash
- constraint and logic programming
- compiling interpreted scripts by tree shaking down to C
- convert between languages
- polyglot library for common types and functions
- polyglot FFI and messaging
- Convert C++ to C-ish: instantiate all templates, explicit construct, destroy, copy, move, convert and return
- theorem proving
- SMT
- parallelism
- effects
- compilation by evaluation
- use type names as implicit variables of that type
- correctness proofs
- types as predicates, values as proofs
